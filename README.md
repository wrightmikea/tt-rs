# tt-rs

**Cartoon-oriented Talking Programming Application**

A modern Rust/WebAssembly reimplementation of ToonTalk, an interactive visual programming environment for learning computational thinking through animated metaphors.

## About

tt-rs brings programming-by-demonstration to modern web browsers. Users create programs by training robots that watch and learn from their actions. The system uses concrete metaphors - birds carry messages, boxes hold data, scales compare values - making abstract computing concepts tangible and accessible.

This is a derived work based on ToonTalk, originally created by Ken Kahn.
