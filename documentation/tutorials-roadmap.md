# Tutorials and Demos Roadmap

This document outlines the planned tutorials and demonstrations for tt-rs, organized by the features they showcase. Each tutorial builds on previous concepts.

## Tutorial Philosophy

Following Ken Kahn's approach from the original ToonTalk:

1. **Learning by doing**: Users discover through interaction, not reading
2. **Concrete before abstract**: Start with specific examples, then generalize
3. **Immediate feedback**: Every action has visible results
4. **No failure states**: Incorrect actions are simply undone, not punished

## Current Demo (Live)

**URL**: https://wrightmikea.github.io/tt-rs/

**Features demonstrated:**
- Dragging widgets from the copy source palette
- Number arithmetic (drop number on number)
- Box manipulation (resize with 0-9 keys while dragging)
- Box joining (drop box on edge of another)
- Box splitting (drop box on number)
- Scales comparison (drop numbers on scales)
- Robot training (click robot to start/stop training)
- Wand tool (copy widgets)
- Vacuum tool (remove widgets)

## Phase 1 Tutorials: Current Features

### Tutorial 1.1: Numbers and Arithmetic

**Concept**: Visual arithmetic through drag-and-drop

**Steps**:
1. Drag a "+5" from the palette to the workspace
2. Drag a "+1" and drop it onto the 5
3. Observe the result: 6
4. Try different operators (-, *, /)
5. Experiment with fractions (1/2, 1/3, etc.)

**Learning outcomes**:
- Numbers can be combined by dropping one on another
- The operator on the dropped number determines the operation
- All arithmetic is exact (rational numbers, no rounding)

### Tutorial 1.2: Boxes and Organization

**Concept**: Containers with compartments (data structures)

**Steps**:
1. Drag a 2-hole box to the workspace
2. Drop a number into the first hole
3. Drop another number into the second hole
4. While dragging a box, press 5 to make it a 5-hole box
5. Join two boxes by dropping one on the edge of another
6. Split a box by dropping it on a number

**Learning outcomes**:
- Boxes organize data into compartments
- Box size can be changed with keyboard 0-9
- Boxes can be combined (joined) or divided (split)

### Tutorial 1.3: Scales and Comparison

**Concept**: Visual comparison of values

**Steps**:
1. Drag scales to the workspace
2. Drop a number on the left side
3. Drop a number on the right side
4. Observe which way the scales tip
5. Try equal values (scales balance)

**Learning outcomes**:
- Scales compare values visually
- Larger values make their side heavier
- Equal values keep scales balanced

### Tutorial 1.4: Robot Training Basics

**Concept**: Programming by demonstration

**Steps**:
1. Create a number "5" and a number "+1"
2. Click the robot to start training (yellow glow)
3. Drag the +1 onto the 5 (making 6)
4. Click the robot to stop training
5. Create new numbers and click robot again
6. Observe: robot replays your action on new data

**Learning outcomes**:
- Robots learn by watching you
- Training records your actions
- Robots can repeat actions automatically

### Tutorial 1.5: Tools - Copy and Remove

**Concept**: Manipulating the workspace

**Steps**:
1. Drag the wand (magic stick with star) to the workspace
2. Touch any widget with the wand - it creates a copy
3. Drag the vacuum to the workspace
4. Touch any widget with vacuum - it removes it
5. Hold vacuum on a box hole to remove just that content

**Learning outcomes**:
- Wand copies any widget
- Vacuum removes widgets
- Tools can target specific parts of containers

## Phase 3 Tutorials: Pattern Matching (Planned)

### Tutorial 3.1: Erasing for Generalization

**Prerequisites**: Tutorial 1.4 (Robot basics)
**Features needed**: Erasure system, improved vacuum

**Steps**:
1. Train robot to double a specific number (e.g., 5 → 10)
2. Robot only works on that exact number
3. Use vacuum on the "5" in robot's memory
4. The number becomes "erased" (any number)
5. Now robot doubles ANY number

**Learning outcomes**:
- Vacuum can erase details from patterns
- Erased widgets match anything of the same type
- This makes robots more general (work with any input)

### Tutorial 3.2: Matching Box Patterns

**Prerequisites**: Tutorial 3.1
**Features needed**: Box pattern matching

**Steps**:
1. Train robot with a 2-hole box containing [3, 5]
2. Erase the numbers to [?, ?]
3. Robot now works on any 2-hole box
4. Try different box contents

**Learning outcomes**:
- Box patterns match structure
- Erasing contents generalizes the pattern
- Robot binds matched values to use in actions

   - If number = 0: stop
2. Give bird to nest's own bird (self-reference)
3. Start with number 5
4. Watch countdown: 5 → 4 → 3 → 2 → 1 → 0

**Learning outcomes**:
- Robots can send work to themselves
- This creates loops (recursion)

- Animated drag-and-drop showing each step
- Visual cues (glow, trail) highlight the action
- Pause/step-through capability for learning

#### Progressive Hints
- After 60 seconds of no progress: generic encouragement
- After 2 minutes: specific hint about next step
- "Give Up" option shows solution without penalty

### Tutorial/Puzzle Error Feedback

Visual feedback helps users understand puzzle state:

| State | Visual Feedback |
|-------|-----------------|
| Initial | Dashed border, neutral colors |
| Correct Answer | Green background, checkmark (✓), success message |
| Wrong Answer | Red/pink background, X mark (✗), "Try again!", shake animation |

Wrong answers allow retry - widget bounces back to original position, and error feedback clears on next attempt
