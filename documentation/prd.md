# tt-rs Product Requirements Document

**Full Name**: Cartoon-oriented Talking Programming Application

## Executive Summary

tt-rs is a modern reimplementation of ToonTalk, an interactive visual programming environment originally created by Ken Kahn in the 1990s. This project brings the innovative programming-by-demonstration approach to modern web browsers using Rust, WebAssembly, and contemporary rendering technologies.

## Background

### ToonTalk History

ToonTalk has evolved through three major versions:

#### Original ToonTalk (Desktop C++ ~1995-2009)

A 3D animated world where programming concepts are mapped to concrete metaphors:

**Core Metaphors:**
| Concept | Metaphor | Description |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| Program | City | Collection of running processes |
| Process | House | Container where robots work |
| Method | Robot | Trained by demonstration |
| Message | Bird delivery | Asynchronous communication |
| Data | Box with holes | Containers with compartments |
| Comparison | Scales | Physical balance that tips |
| Pattern | Erased widget | Generalized by removing detail |

**Navigation & Process Management:**
- **Helicopter**: Fly over the city to navigate between houses
- **Truck**: Drop robot+box to spawn a new house (process)
- **Bomb**: Destroys a house (terminates process)
- **Notebook**: Store programs, serve as modules when dropped in truck

**Tools:**
- **Wand (Magic)**: Copy any widget
- **Vacuum (Dusty)**: Remove/erase widgets (suck, erase, spit modes)
- **Pump (Pumpy)**: Resize widgets

The system was influenced by Janus (concurrent constraint logic programming), the Actor model, and video games like Zelda and Robot Odyssey. Successfully used by children as young as 3 years old.

#### ToonTalk Reborn (JavaScript/jQuery ~2014-2017)

A web-based version that simplified some concepts for browser compatibility:

**Features Retained:**
- Numbers, Boxes, Text, Robots, Birds, Nests, Scales
- Wand and Vacuum tools
- Robot training and execution
- Pattern matching via erasure
- Sensors for keyboard/mouse events

**Features Removed/Changed:**
- No 3D city navigation
- No houses (flat workspace instead)
- No trucks, bombs, helicopter
- Simplified vacuum (no suck/spit modes)
- 2D interface only

**Technology:**
- jQuery and jQuery UI
- JSON program storage
- Google Drive integration
- Multilingual (100+ languages)

#### tt-rs (Rust/WebAssembly ~2024-present)

This project aims to:
1. Modernize the technology stack (Rust/WASM)
2. Initially match ToonTalk Reborn capabilities
3. Eventually restore original ToonTalk features
4. Add new innovations (3D graphics, design patterns, AI assistance)

## Product Vision

**For** children, educators, and curious adults
**Who** want to learn programming through visual, interactive exploration
**tt-rs is** a web-based visual programming environment
**That** teaches computational thinking through animated metaphors and programming by demonstration
**Unlike** text-based programming or simplified block coding
**Our product** provides a deeply interactive, game-like experience where abstract concepts become tangible objects.

## Target Users

### Primary Users

1. **Children (ages 5-12)**
   - Little to no programming experience
   - Comfortable with touch/mouse interfaces
   - May not read fluently

2. **Educators**
   - Teachers introducing computational thinking
   - After-school program leaders
   - Homeschool parents

3. **Curious Adults**
   - Alternative programming paradigm enthusiasts
   - Those intimidated by traditional programming
   - Concurrent programming learners

### Secondary Users

1. **Researchers**: CS education, programming languages, HCI
2. **Developers**: Rust/WASM game development, educational software

## User Stories

### MVP Stories

1. **As a child**, I want to drag a number onto another number to add them, so I can do arithmetic visually.

2. **As a child**, I want to train a robot by showing it what to do, so I can automate tasks.

3. **As a child**, I want to give something to a bird and watch it fly to its nest, so I can understand message passing.

4. **As a child**, I want to put things in boxes and take them out, so I can organize my work.

5. **As an educator**, I want to save and share programs, so students can continue their work.

6. **As a user**, I want to watch a robot work step-by-step, so I can understand what it's doing.

7. **As a user**, I want to erase parts of a pattern, so my robot can work with many different inputs.

### Workspace Persistence Stories

8. **As a user**, I want to save my current workspace with a name and description, so I can return to it later.

9. **As a user**, I want to see a list of my saved workspaces with their descriptions, so I can choose which one to load.

10. **As a user**, I want to load a saved workspace and have it restore all widgets in their saved positions, so I can continue my work.

11. **As an educator**, I want to create a workspace with a trained robot and save it as a tutorial, so students can learn by example.

12. **As a user**, I want to export a workspace to a file, so I can share it with others or back it up.

13. **As a user**, I want to import a workspace from a file someone shared with me, so I can explore their programs.

14. **As a user**, I want to access bundled example workspaces (tutorials) that demonstrate features, so I can learn how to use the application.

15. **As a user**, I want each saved workspace to remember which user level (tt1/tt2) it was created in, so tutorials can target specific learning stages.

### Advanced Stories

16. **As an advanced user**, I want to create recursive programs using birds and nests, so I can compute factorials.

17. **As an advanced user**, I want multiple robots in different houses, so I can build parallel systems.
