# tt-rs Implementation Plan

**Full Name**: Cartoon-oriented Talking Programming Application

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for tt-rs, tracking both current progress and future work. The plan supports two implementation strategies:
1. **MVP Path**: Focus on ToonTalk Reborn (2017 jQuery) feature parity first
2. **Full Vision**: Eventually implement all original ToonTalk (1995 C++) features plus new innovations

**Note**: This is a derived work based on ToonTalk. See the COPYRIGHT file for attribution.

## Short-Term Roadmap (Next 3 Iterations)

### Iteration 1: Bird/Nest Messaging (MVP Critical)

**Goal**: Enable asynchronous communication - the heart of ToonTalk's concurrency model.

#### 1.1 Nest Widget
- [ ] Create `tt-rs-nest` crate in widgets component
- [ ] Implement `Nest` struct with contents queue
- [ ] Implement nest rendering (egg visual)
- [ ] Implement `take()` method for retrieving contents

#### 1.2 Bird Widget
- [ ] Create `tt-rs-bird` crate in widgets component
- [ ] Implement `Bird` struct with nest reference
- [ ] Implement bird rendering (animated sprite)
- [ ] Bird colors matching nest colors

#### 1.3 Message Delivery
- [ ] Implement "give to bird" drag operation
- [ ] Bird flight animation to nest
- [ ] Nest receives and queues message
- [ ] Bird returns to original position

#### 1.4 Demo/Tutorial
- [ ] Add bird/nest pair to demo widgets
- [ ] Add tutorial section explaining messaging
- [ ] Example: send number to nest, retrieve it

### Iteration 2: Pattern Matching & Erasure

**Goal**: Enable robots to work with generalized patterns, not just specific values.

#### 2.1 Erasure System
- [ ] Define `ErasureLevel` enum (Specific, Sign, Type)
- [ ] Extend Number with erasure level field
- [ ] Vacuum tool creates erased copies (multi-click levels)
- [ ] Visual indication of erased widgets (ghosted/transparent)

#### 2.2 Pattern Matching
- [ ] Implement `matches()` for erased Numbers
- [ ] Implement `matches()` for Boxes (recursive)
- [ ] Extract bindings during match
- [ ] Robot condition checking uses matches()

#### 2.3 Robot Generalization
- [ ] Robot thought bubble shows conditions
- [ ] Erase widget in conditions to generalize
- [ ] Bindings passed to action execution

#### 2.4 Demo/Tutorial
- [ ] Tutorial: "Train robot, then erase number to work with any number"
- [ ] Example: Doubling robot (works on any input)

### Iteration 3: Persistence & Sharing

**Goal**: Save and load workspaces so users can continue their work.

#### 3.1 JSON Serialization
- [ ] Define JSON schema for all widgets
- [ ] Implement `serialize()` for each widget type
- [ ] Implement `deserialize()` for each widget type
- [ ] Handle widget references (birds→nests)

#### 3.2 Local Storage
- [ ] Save workspace to localStorage
- [ ] Load workspace from localStorage
- [ ] Auto-save on changes (debounced)
- [ ] Workspace naming/listing

#### 3.3 File Export/Import
- [ ] Export workspace to JSON file
- [ ] Import workspace from JSON file
- [ ] Drag-drop file to import

#### 3.4 URL Sharing (Optional)
- [ ] Encode small programs in URL
- [ ] Decode and load from URL parameter

- Speed control slider
- Visual highlighting of current action
- Robot chaining (sequential robots)

### Iteration 7: Text Operations

### Iteration 8: Element Widget
- HTML content widgets
- SVG graphics support
- Drag images from browser
- Attribute editing

- Enter/exit house navigation
- Houses receive input via birds

### Phase B: Trucks & Bombs (Process Management)
- Truck widget (process spawner)
- Drop robot+box in truck → new house
- Bomb widget (process terminator)
- Clean process shutdown

### Phase C: Helicopter & Navigation
- Helicopter for flying between houses
- City map view
- Street addresses
- Bird flight paths visible in city

### Phase D: Additional Tools
- Pumpy (bike pump) for resizing
- Notebook for program storage/modules
- Team of robots (alternative behaviors)

## Future Innovations (Beyond Original ToonTalk)

### 3D Graphics Mode
- Three.js integration
- 3D widget rendering
- Physics-based animations
- VR/AR exploration

### Design Pattern Library
- Pre-built robot patterns (Observer, Iterator, etc.)
- Visual representation of patterns
- Drag-and-drop pattern application

### Cross-Language Concepts
- Inspired by Alice, Scratch, Blockly
- Visual data flow
- State machine visualization

## Code Quality Maintenance

### sw-checklist Standards
Run `sw-checklist .` before commits. Thresholds:
- Functions: max 50 LOC (warn >25)
- Modules: max 7 functions (warn >4)
- Crates: max 7 modules (warn >4)
- Projects: max 7 crates (warn >4)

### Refactoring Triggers
When approaching limits, split proactively:
- Large function → Extract helper functions
- Large module → Split by responsibility
- Large crate → Extract new crate

See the "Code Quality Refactoring Plan" section at the end for specific guidance.

## Appendix: Code Quality Refactoring Plan

This section tracks specific refactoring needs identified by sw-checklist.

### Priority Refactoring Tasks

| Priority | Issue | Action |
|----------|-------|--------|
| 1 | app.rs is large | Already split into app/, ops/, robot_exec/, widget_item/ modules |
| 2 | help_panel.rs has many functions | Split into basics.rs, advanced.rs |
| 3 | robot.rs has many functions | Split into robot/, types.rs, ops.rs, mutators.rs |
| 4 | scales.rs has many functions | Split into scales/, ops.rs, mutators.rs |

### Completed Refactoring
- ✅ App component modularized (callbacks, render, ops)
- ✅ Help panel split (basics, advanced)
- ✅ Robot module split (types, ops, mutators)
- ✅ Scales module split (ops, mutators)
- ✅ Box tests split (creation, resize, erased)
